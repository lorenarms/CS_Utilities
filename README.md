<h2>CS_Utilities</h2>
<p>A repository of utility classes I use for other programs. Each of these classes were designed by me from scratch (but ideas came from other places sometimes). I use these classes in my other programs in C#. All classes have comments to explain their use, plus a 'driver' application to run as an example.</p>
<p>Feel free to use as needed, just give me some credit (a simple link back is fine). Thanks, and enjoy!</p>
