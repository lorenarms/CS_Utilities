<h2>CS_Utilities</h2>
<p>A repository of utility classes I use for other programs. Each of these classes were designed by me from scratch (but ideas came from other places sometimes). I use these classes in my other programs in C#. All classes have comments to explain their use, plus a 'driver' application to run as an example.</p>
<p>Some of these apps were developed after other problems were presented to me from various sources. For example, the "PatternFinder" app was developed based on a question from a technical assessment I took for an interview. The problem involved the user being presented with a "picture" delivered as an array of strings, with each string representing one line of data from a picture. The data is assumed to be pixel data for the picture. Another array of strings is also delivered, this one smaller and representing a pattern that may or may not be found within the original picture's data. The algorithm I developed showcases how this would work, returning the upper-leftmost coordinate of the location within the picture if the pattern is found. As an added feature, the application displays the picture data with the pattern highlighted within it. All of this is done using basic logic commands, no extra library funcitons (like Regex), so the app could be migrated to another language as needed</p>
<p>Feel free to use as needed, just give me some credit (a simple link back is fine). Thanks, and enjoy!</p>
